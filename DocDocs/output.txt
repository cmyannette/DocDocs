Doctor: "Hi there What can I help you with today Hi I've developed this itchy rash on my arm and it's starting to spread I'm not sure what it is"
Patient: "I see How long have you had the rash And when did it start spreading"
Doctor: "Showed up about five days ago Just on my wrist Then over the past couple of days it spread up my forearm It's really itchy and a bit red"
Patient: "That sounds uncomfortable Have you used any new lotions soaps or detergents recently"
Doctor: "Not really But I did go hiking last week So I thought maybe it could be poison ivy or something"
Patient: "That's possible Poison ivy or another plant could definitely cause a rash like this Is it blistering or just red and"
Doctor: "itchy No blisters just red and itchy but it seems to be getting worse Not better"
Patient: "It's good that there aren't any blisters but since it's spreading we'll wanna treat it I'd recommend using an over the counter hydrocortisone cream to help with the itching and make sure to keep the area clean and dry if it doesn't improve or continues to spread We may need to look at prescription options How does that sound"
Doctor: "That sounds good I've been trying not to scratch it but it's hard"
Patient: "I understand scratching can make it worse So try applying cool compresses if it gets too uncomfortable"
Doctor: "Let's check in again if you don't see any improvement after using the cream for a few days I will Thanks for the advice"
Patient: "You're welcome Take care and feel free to reach out if anything changes"
